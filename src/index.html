    <h3>Who is Adam?</h3>
    <p>I'm a family man with a passion for building and creating; as well as discovering new things.  I love to learn and grow.  I have had a love for computers and coding ever since I was in grade school.  I've decided that now is the second best time to make a concerted effort to learn to code, the first best time would have been 20 years ago.</p>
